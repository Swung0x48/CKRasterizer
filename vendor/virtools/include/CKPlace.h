Summary: Group of 3D entities.

Remarks:
    + CKPlaces are the basic bricks for the logical grouping of 3D entities, and for attaching behaviors to groups of entities.

    + Every objects that are children of a place are marked as belonging to this place.

    + 3D entities, like lights, cameras, 3D objects, characters, etc... are logically grouped into places.
    A 3d entity cannot belong to more than one place, but some entities may be attached to no place. They
    will be displayed and activated if they are global to the current scene or level or to the whole game.

    + Portals can be used to declare the links between places so that a quick rejection
    can be performed by a portal manager to remove unseen places from a given place.

    + Portals are represented by a CK3dEntity and are considered as a unit box in the entity referential.

    + The class id of CKPlace is CKCID_PLACE.
