/************************************************************
Summary: Vertex buffer class.

Remarks:
+ The CKVertexBuffer class provides an interface to create and manage a vertex buffer.

+ For devices that supports vertex buffer in hardware this can enable very fast rendering
as the vertex data is already on the video card.

+ For other devices the implementation will provide a system memory pointer to hold the vertex
data so that the user does not have to worry of the underlying implementation

+ A vertex buffer is created through the CKRenderManager::CreateVertexBuffer method.
and can be destroyed with the CKVertexBuffer::Destroy or CKRenderManager::DestroyVertexBuffer

+ The CKVertexBuffer class is mainly designed for static vertex buffers. If a vertex buffer is needed to be very frequently updated (dynamic vertex buffer) , the
RCKRenderContext::GetDrawPrimitiveStructure with the CKRST_DP_VBUFFER is a better solution and
avoids the creation of a CKVertexBuffer instance.

    Summary: Checks the state of the vertex buffer.
    Return Value
        Current State of the vertex buffer:
        CK_VB_LOST : The content of the vertex buffer was lost (device changes,etc..) and should filled back (Lock)
        CK_VB_OK: No Error , Vertex buffer can be rendered (Draw)
        CK_VB_FAILED: Vertex buffer could not be created
    Arguments:
        Ctx: A pointer to a CKRenderContext on which this vertex buffer should be used.
        MaxVertexCount: Max number of vertex the buffer can contain.
        Format: A combination of CKRST_DPFLAGS giving the vertex format for this vertex buffer.
        Dynamic: A boolean indicating if this vertex buffer will be frequently written too...
    Remarks:
    + There is not a method to create a vertex buffer, instead one should use this method
    to check the vertex buffer before each drawing.
    + The return value indicates whether the vertex buffer is up-to-date (CK_VB_OK) or if its content should
    be updated (CK_VB_LOST), or even if the creation of such a vertex buffer failed (CK_VB_FAILED).

    Remarks:

    Remarks:
    + This method renders a set of primitives (using Indices if given otherwise taking vertices in the order they are given).
